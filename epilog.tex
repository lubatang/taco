\section{This is an example of Appendix section head}

Channel-switching time is measured as the time length it takes for
motes to successfully switch from one channel to another. This
parameter impacts the maximum network throughput, because motes
cannot receive or send any packet during this period of time, and it
also affects the efficiency of toggle snooping in MMSN, where motes
need to sense through channels rapidly.

By repeating experiments 100 times, we get the average
channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3 $\mu$s. We then conduct
the same experiments with different Micaz motes, as well as
experiments with the transmitter switching from Channel 11 to other
channels. In both scenarios, the channel-switching time does not have
obvious changes. (In our experiments, all values are in the range of
23.6 $\mu$s to 24.9 $\mu$s.)

\section{Appendix section head}

The primary consumer of energy in WSNs is idle listening. The key to
reduce idle listening is executing low duty-cycle on nodes. Two
primary approaches are considered in controlling duty-cycles in the
MAC layer.
