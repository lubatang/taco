In this appendix, we measure
the channel switching time of Micaz [CROSSBOW] sensor devices.
In our experiments, one mote alternatingly switches between Channels
11 and 12. Every time after the node switches to a channel, it sends
out a packet immediately and then changes to a new channel as soon
as the transmission is finished. We measure the
number of packets the test mote can send in 10 seconds, denoted as
$N_{1}$. In contrast, we also measure the same value of the test
mote without switching channels, denoted as $N_{2}$. We calculate
the channel-switching time $s$ as
\begin{eqnarray}%
s=\frac{10}{N_{1}}-\frac{10}{N_{2}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}%
By repeating the experiments 100 times, we get the average
channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3$\mu$s.
