\begin{abstract}
This paper describes MCLinker, a linker framework designed to support {\em whole program analysis and optimization} by providing a global system view to transformations. MCLinker defines a {\em generic representation} of global system modules, a fragment-reference graph. Fragment-reference graph is characterized by the use-define relationships among all modules. It allows transformations to perform analysis and optimization with universal information on all modules in the program. More than traditional use-define chain which used in compilers, MCLinker's fragment-reference graph provides global address information. The address information allows transformations to perform more agressive analysis and optimization that traditional compilers cannot perform as well as, such as branch optimization and branch-island elimination. In addition to the module representation, MCLinker also defines four {\em clear transformation phases} for sophsiticated analysis and optimization: normalization, resolution, layout and emission. To our best know, MCLinker is the first linker who separates the linking process into four clear phases and defines these phases in mathematic terms. By the clear mathematical definitions, we develop delicated, {\em fast linking algorithms} and can run very fast on poor mobile devices with small memory usage. The MCLinker generic representation, clear transformation phases and fast algorithms together provide the capacity for throughout program analysis and optimization. We describe the design of MCLinker framework, algorithms and representations and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) linking speed (b) the size	and effectiveness of the represenation, and (c) the lines of code and number of supported platforms. In our experiments, MCLinker runs steadily 100\% faster than GNU ld, and 30\% faster than the Google gold linker. MCLinker spends less time to handle symbols and relocations with smaller memory usage. MCLinker's lines of code are only 20\% of GNU ld's and 50\% of the Google gold linker's. Although GNU ld supports more legendary devices, MCLinker has already supported more target platforms than the Google gold linker.
